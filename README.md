# Auto Password Gamer
An almost automagic solver for https://neal.fun/password-game/

## How to use it
- 👉 Copy the code you find in ```littlehelper.js``` into your browsers console.
- ⚠️ It uses online resources that may take some time or fail, e.g. while solving the chess problem, geo guessing.
- ⚠️ YouTube IDs can conflict with the atoms summing to 200 (rule 18).
- ⚠️ Current time might be an issue conflicting with rule 5.
- 💡 Sometimes deleting a part of the password may help.


## Q & A
- Can it solve the game faster?
  -  Luke, check the source. You might consider shortening the debounce delay, though the script was designed to mimic user behaviour, not prioritize speed.

## To be fixed
- Last step where you have to re-type your password

# Auto Password Gamer
An almost automagic solver for https://neal.fun/password-game/

## How to use it
- 👉 Copy the code you find in ```autosolver.js``` into your browsers console.
- ⚠️ It uses online resources that may take some time or fail, e.g. while solving the chess problem, geo guessing.
- ⚠️ YouTube IDs can conflict with the atoms summing to 200 (rule 18).
- ⚠️ Current time might be an issue conflicting with rule 5.
- 💡 Sometimes deleting a part of the password may help.
- 💡 Copy the password before proceeding with final step.

## Q & A
- Can it solve the game faster?
    - Luke, check the source. You might consider shortening the debounce delay, though the script was designed to mimic user behaviour, not prioritize speed.


## Todo / Fixes needed
- Create a bookmarklet for sideloading the script.

## Credits
- I used the list with YouTube IDs that is available on the web on various sites. Thank you for that.

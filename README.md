# Auto Password Gamer
An almost automagic solver for https://neal.fun/password-game/

## How to use it
- üëâ Copy the code you find in ```littlehelper.js``` into your browsers console.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è It uses online resources that may take some time or fail, e.g. while solving the chess problem, geo guessing.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è YouTube IDs can conflict with the atoms summing to 200 (rule 18).
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Current time might be an issue conflicting with rule 5.
- üí° Sometimes deleting a part of the password may help.
- üí° Copy the password before proceeding with final step.

## Q & A
- Can it solve the game faster?
    - Luke, check the source. You might consider shortening the debounce delay, though the script was designed to mimic user behaviour, not prioritize speed.


## Todo
- Refresh captch until no digits are contained.
- Add ```pre``` with password in plaintext for debugging purposes.
- Create a bookmarklet for sideloading the script.
- replace vowels with format

## Credits
- I used the list with YouTube IDs that is available on the web on various sites. Thank you for that.
